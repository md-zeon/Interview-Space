# When You Get an Error, What Do You Think About It and How Do You Fix It?

This question explores your debugging mindset, systematic thinking, and problem-solving process. Show that you approach errors calmly, methodically, and learn from them.

## Debugging Mindset:
- Don't panic - errors are normal part of development
- View errors as learning opportunities
- Stay calm and systematic under pressure
- Think before acting

## Systematic Approach to Debugging (Steps):
1. **Understand the Error**: Read the message carefully, note exact text, line number, stack trace
2. **Reproduce the Issue**: Try to recreate the problem consistently
3. **Isolate the Cause**: Use debugging tools, logs, breakpoints to narrow down
4. **Form Hypothesis**: Make educated guesses based on evidence
5. **Test Changes**: Implement and verify fixes incrementally
6. **Validate Solution**: Ensure fix resolves issue and doesn't break other functionality

## Sample Answer:

"When I encounter an error, I first take a deep breath and approach it systematically rather than randomly trying fixes. I believe errors are feedback that helps me improve my code and understanding.

For example, recently I got a 'null pointer exception' in a payment processing function. First, I checked the error stack trace to pinpoint exactly where it occurred – line 145 in the calculateTotal method.

I reproduced the issue by running the same input that triggered it, then added debug logs to trace variable values. I discovered that an optional credit card field was null when passed from the frontend.

I fixed this by adding proper null checks: `if (cardDetails != null && cardDetails.number != null)` before processing. I also added unit tests to prevent similar issues in the future.

This systematic approach ensures I'm addressing root causes rather than symptoms, and helps me write more robust code overall."

## Common Debugging Tools and Techniques:
- **Logs**: Console.log, server logs, application logs
- **Debugger**: Breakpoints, step-through execution, watch variables
- **Unit Tests**: Write tests to isolate and verify fixes
- **Version Control**: Binary search commits (git bisect)
- **External Help**: Rubber duck debugging, code reviews

## Tips:
- Don't guess - gather information first
- Change one thing at a time
- Document your debugging process for future reference
- Learn from each error - avoid repeating mistakes
- Ask for help when stuck (after exhausting your own efforts)
- Use version control to experiment safely
- Prioritize: fix critical errors first, log non-critical for later
- Share your debugging approach - it shows analytical thinking
