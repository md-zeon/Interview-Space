## Sample Answer

"I've worked in software engineering for over 4 years, progressing from junior developer to senior roles with increasing responsibility for system architecture and team leadership.

In my most recent position as Software Engineer at XYZ Tech, I've spent the last 2 years building scalable web applications using React, Node.js, and cloud technologies. I led the development of a real-time analytics dashboard that improved customer support efficiency by 35%, serving over 10,000 daily active users.

Before that, I worked at ABC Solutions for 2 years as a full-stack developer, where I contributed to a team migration from legacy systems to microservices architecture. This experience gave me deep knowledge in Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

Throughout my career, I've focused on writing clean, testable code while mentoring junior developers and participating in code reviews to maintain high quality standards. I'm particularly proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and various AWS services."
