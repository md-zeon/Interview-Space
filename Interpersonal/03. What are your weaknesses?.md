# What are Your Weaknesses?

This question tests your self-awareness and ability to improve. Choose real weaknesses, but frame them positively by showing how you're working to overcome them. Never say you have no weaknesses.

## Sample Structure:
1. **Choose a Weakness**: Pick something real but not a core job requirement (e.g., avoid saying you're bad at teamwork if the role requires it).
2. **Provide Context**: Give a brief example.
3. **Show Improvement**: Explain what you've done or are doing to address it.
4. **Connect Positively**: Highlight how this growth has benefited you professionally.

## Sample Answer:

"One weakness I've worked on is being overly critical of my own work, which sometimes slowed me down in meeting deadlines. For instance, I would spend excessive time perfecting details on projects, leading to inefficiencies.

To address this, I've been prioritizing tasks and setting realistic timelines using techniques like time-blocking. I've also started seeking feedback from colleagues early on. This has helped me complete projects more efficiently while maintaining quality, and it has improved my ability to delegate when appropriate.

I view this experience as an opportunity for growth, as it has made me more aware of work-life balance and overall productivity."

## Alternative Weaknesses (Tailor to Your Situation):
- Public speaking (taking courses, joining Toastmasters)
- Impatience with slow-paced processes (learning to focus on long-term goals)
- Overcommitting (improving time management and saying no when needed)
- Detailed-oriented but missing big picture (incorporating strategic planning)

## Tips:
- Choose only one weakness to discuss in depth.
- Stay professional and brief.
- Focus on self-improvement and learning.
- Use the past tense for the weakness: "I used to struggle with..."
- Practice to ensure it sounds genuine, not rehearsed.
- If possible, tie back to how it improves your fit for the role.
