# What is Your Salary Range Expectation?

This sensitive question requires preparation and tact. The goal is to give a realistic range based on research, while showing flexibility and allowing room for negotiation.

## Preparation Research:
- Check salary data: Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Payscale, LinkedIn
- Consider your location, experience level, and market rates
- Factor in cost of living adjustments
- Research the specific company size and industry
- Know your current compensation and desired growth

## Approach Guidelines:
- Don't answer immediately - deflect if possible
- Research and give a range (not a single number)
- Consider total compensation (salary + benefits + bonuses)
- Be realistic but confident
- Show flexibility

## Sample Responses:

**Deflection First**: "I'd like to learn more about the full compensation package and benefits before discussing specific numbers. Could you tell me about your compensation structure for this role?"

**After Research**: "Based on my research of similar roles in this market and my 4 years of experience, I'm looking for a salary in the range of $120,000 - $140,000, plus equity and benefits. Is that in line with your budget for this position?"

**Location Specific**: "Given my location in [City/State], where cost of living is [reference], and my skill set, I'm targeting $110,000 - $125,000 annually, including performance bonuses."

**With Experience Level**: "For a senior software engineering role with my background, I've seen ranges between $130,000 - $150,000 in similar positions at comparable companies."

## Key Factors to Consider:
- **Current Salary**: Can't be disclosed in some countries (like USA)
- **Market Rate**: Research 50th percentile for your level/location
- **Your Value**: Based on skills, experience, impact
- **Location**: Adjust for COL (San Francisco vs. other locations)
- **Total Package**: Include equity, bonuses, benefits, WFH options
- **Gaps**: Leave room for negotiation (10-20% range)

## Tips:
- Never lowball yourself to increase chances of interview
- Know your absolute minimum and ideal target
- Practice comfortable delivery
- Be prepared for counter-questions
- If asked for current salary: Redirect to expectations or decline
- Consider interviewers trained to ask "what's your number?"

## Common Mistakes:
- Giving a single number (leaves no negotiation room)
- Asking "What does the company pay?" (shows lack of preparation)
- Undervaluing your skills out of fear of rejection
- Overvaluing and pricing yourself out
- Not factoring in benefits/equity/remote work perks
- Being uncomfortable or apologetic

## Negotiation Tips:
- Have a target number and floor number in mind
- Ask about full benefits package
- Consider signing bonus, equity, PTO as part of total comp
- Be open to negotiation based on other factors
- Know when to walk away vs. when to compromise

## When to Bring It Up:
- Company brings it up first
- Toward end of interview process
- After multiple interviews and clear interest
- When asked about "concerns" or "questions for us"
