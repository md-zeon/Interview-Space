# Do You Have Any Questions?

This is YOUR opportunity to show deep interest in the role and company. Always have thoughtful questions prepared. Generic questions show lack of preparation - quality questions demonstrate research and genuine interest.

## Research First:
- Company website (about page, news, careers)
- Recent news/articles about the company
- Technology stack and current projects
- Company culture, values, and recent initiatives
- Team structure and growth plans

## Question Categories:
1. **Role-Specific**: Clarify responsibilities and expectations
2. **Team Structure**: Team dynamics and collaboration
3. **Company Culture**: Values, work environment, growth
4. **Technology Stack**: Tools, processes, current challenges
5. **Career Growth**: Learning opportunities and advancement
6. **Next Steps**: Interview timeline and decision process

## Smart Questions to Ask:

**About the Role:**
- "Could you elaborate on the day-to-day responsibilities for this position?"
- "What would success look like for this role in the first 6 months?"
- "How does this role contribute to the team's overall objectives?"

**About the Team:**
- "Can you tell me about the team I would be working with?"
- "How does the team collaborate on projects?"
- "What does the onboarding process look like for new team members?"

**About Technology & Projects:**
- "What are the biggest technical challenges the team is currently facing?"
- "How does the team approach testing and deployment?"
- "Are there opportunities to work with emerging technologies or contribute to open source?"

**About Company & Culture:**
- "What are the company's biggest priorities for the next year?"
- "How does the company support professional development?"
- "What do you enjoy most about working here?"

**About Growth & Future:**
- "What are the opportunities for advancement in this role?"
- "How does performance evaluation work here?"
- "What's your favorite part about the company culture?"

## Questions to Avoid:
- Questions you can answer from company website
- Salary/compensation questions (if not discussed)
- "When will I start?" (shows over-eagerness)
- "Do you do background checks?" (negative connotation)
- "What does the company do?" (lack of research)

## Preparation Strategy:
- Prepare 5-7 questions, use 3-4 per interviewer
- Tailor questions to the person you're speaking with
- Take notes during interview to ask follow-ups
- Show enthusiasm through questions
- End with: "Is there anything else you think I should know about the role or company?"

## Why Questions Matter:
- Shows genuine interest and enthusiasm
- Demonstrates preparation and research
- Reveals if you're a good fit for the company
- Provides valuable information for your decision
- Can turn the interview into a conversation

## Handling the Response:
- If they say "We covered everything," respond positively
- If they ask "Any other questions?" it's your cue to ask one good question
- After they answer, you can ask 1-2 follow-ups
- Always thank them and express interest

## Cultural Notes:
- Some companies see many questions as intrusive
- Others view thoughtful questions as a sign of intelligence
