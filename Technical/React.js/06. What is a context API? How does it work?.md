# What is a Context API? How does it work?

The Context API in React is a feature that allows you to share data across the component tree without passing props down manually through every level of the tree. This is particularly useful for global state management, such as user information, themes, or application settings that multiple components need access to.

## Key Concepts:
- **Context Object**: Created using `React.createContext()` or the modern `createContext` from the React library.
- **Provider**: A component that supplies the context value to its child components.
- **Consumer**: Components that subscribe to context changes, either using the `useContext` hook or the `Context.Consumer` render prop.

## How it Works:
1. **Create the Context**: Use `const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue)` to create a context.

2. **Provide the Context**: Wrap your component tree with the `Provider` component:
   ```jsx
   <MyContext.Provider value={someValue}>
     <ChildComponent />
   </MyContext.Provider>
   ```

3. **Consume the Context**: In child components, use the `useContext` hook to access the value:
   ```jsx
   const value = useContext(MyContext);
   ```

## Example:
```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

// Create context
const ThemeContext = createContext('light');

// Provider component
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Consumer component
function Toolbar() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <div>Current theme: {theme}</div>;
}
```

The Context API works by maintaining a separate context object in the React tree, and when a component using a context re-renders, it can efficiently determine if it needs to update based on the context value changes. It's an alternative to prop drilling and can be used alongside libraries like Redux for complex state management needs.
