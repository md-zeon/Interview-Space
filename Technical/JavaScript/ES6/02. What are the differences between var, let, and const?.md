# What are the differences between var, let, and const?

## `var`
- **Scope**: Function-scope (or global if declared outside a function)
- **Hoisting**: Hoisted to the top of the function scope and initialized with `undefined`
- **Reassignment**: Can be reassigned
- **Redeclaration**: Can be redeclared in the same scope
- **Block Scope**: Not block-scoped; variables declared with `var` inside a block (e.g., if statement) are accessible outside that block in the same function scope

## `let`
- **Scope**: Block-scope (limited to the block, statement, or expression where it's declared)
- **Hoisting**: Hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone - TDZ)
- **Reassignment**: Can be reassigned
- **Redeclaration**: Cannot be redeclared in the same scope, but can be in different scopes
- **Block Scope**: Strict block scoping prevents access outside the block

## `const`
- **Scope**: Block-scope (same as `let`)
- **Hoisting**: Hoisted but not initialized (TDZ, same as `let`)
- **Reassignment**: Cannot be reassigned (reference is constant, but properties of objects/arrays can be mutated)
- **Redeclaration**: Cannot be redeclared in any scope
- **Block Scope**: Same as `let`

### Key Differences:
1. **Scope**: `var` is function-scoped, `let` and `const` are block-scoped
2. **Hoisting**: `var` is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`, `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized
3. **Reassignment**: `const` cannot be reassigned, `var` and `let` can
4. **Redeclaration**: `var` allows redeclaration, `let` and `const` do not in the same scope
5. **Use Case**: Use `const` for constants that shouldn't change, `let` for variables that need reassignment, avoid `var` in modern code due to scoping issues

**Example:**
```javascript
// var: accessible everywhere in function
function example1() {
    if (true) {
        var a = 1;
    }
    console.log(a); // 1
}

// let: only in block
function example2() {
    if (true) {
        let b = 2;
    }
    console.log(b); // ReferenceError
}

// const: constant reference
const c = 3;
// c = 4; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
