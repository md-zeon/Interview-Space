# What is Docker?

## Introduction to Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package an application and its dependencies together.

## Key Concepts of Docker

### Containerization

Containerization is a technology that allows you to package an application along with its dependencies, configurations, and runtime environment into a single, portable container. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.

### Docker Image

A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container. Images are built from a Dockerfile and are stored in a registry like Docker Hub.

### Docker Container

A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, providing a consistent runtime environment.

## Why Docker?

### Portability

Applications packaged in containers can run on any system that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

### Scalability

Docker enables easy scaling of applications by running multiple container instances across different hosts.

### Isolation

Each container runs in its own isolated environment, preventing conflicts between different applications and their dependencies.

### Resource Efficiency

Containers share the host system's kernel, making them more lightweight than traditional virtual machines.

## Basic Docker Commands

### Running a Container

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

### Building an Image

```bash
docker build -t my-image .
```

### Listing Containers

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### Listing Images

```bash
docker images
```

## Docker Architecture

### Docker Client

The Docker client is the command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with Docker.

### Docker Daemon

The Docker daemon (dockerd) is a background process that manages Docker containers and images on the host system.

### Docker Registry

A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry, while private registries can be set up for internal use.

## Conclusion

Docker simplifies the process of developing, packaging, and deploying applications by providing a consistent containerization platform. It promotes the "build once, run anywhere" philosophy and has become an essential tool in modern software development and DevOps practices.
