# Differences between HTML4 and HTML5

HTML5 is the latest evolution of the HTML standard, offering significant improvements over HTML4. Below is a comprehensive comparison highlighting the key differences.

## Document Type Declaration

### HTML4

- Multiple doctypes: Strict, Transitional, and Frameset
- Example: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">`

### HTML5

- Single, simplified doctype: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- No need to reference external DTD files
- Backward compatible with HTML4

## Semantic Elements

### HTML4

- Relied heavily on `<div>` elements for structure
- Generic elements without semantic meaning

### HTML5

- Introduced semantic elements for better structure and accessibility:
  - `<header>` - Header sections
  - `<footer>` - Footer sections
  - `<section>` - Thematic sections
  - `<article>` - Self-contained content
  - `<nav>` - Navigation links
  - `<aside>` - Sidebar or related content
  - `<main>` - Main content of the page

## Multimedia Support

### HTML4

- Limited multimedia support
- Used `<object>` and `<embed>` tags for media
- No native support for audio/video playback

### HTML5

- Native `<audio>` and `<video>` elements
- Support for multiple formats (MP3, MP4, OGG, etc.)
- Built-in controls, playback APIs, and event handling
- `<canvas>` element for 2D graphics and animations

## Form Enhancements

### HTML4

- Limited input types: text, password, checkbox, radio, submit, reset, file, hidden, image, button
- No built-in validation

### HTML5

- New input types:
  - `email` - Email addresses
  - `url` - URLs
  - `tel` - Telephone numbers
  - `number` - Numeric values
  - `range` - Sliders
  - `date` - Date pickers
  - `datetime-local` - Local date/time
  - `search` - Search fields
  - `color` - Color pickers
- Built-in form validation
- `placeholder`, `autocomplete`, and `required` attributes

## Character Encoding

### HTML4

- Explicit meta tag required: `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">`

### HTML5

- Simplified: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
- UTF-8 encoding by default

## Script and Style Handling

### HTML4

- Required `type` attribute for scripts and styles
- Example: `<script type="text/javascript">`

### HTML5

- `type` attribute optional (defaults to JavaScript for scripts, CSS for styles)
- Support for `async` and `defer` attributes for script loading

## APIs and Capabilities

### HTML4

- Limited to basic DOM manipulation

### HTML5

- Web Storage API (`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`)
- Canvas 2D drawing API
- Geolocation API
- Web Workers for background processing
- WebSocket for two-way communication
- Application Cache for offline functionality (superseded by Service Workers)
- History API for browser history manipulation

## Compatibility and Standards

### HTML4

- Fixed specification with versions (4.01)
- Strict adherence to W3C standards

### HTML5

- Living standard that evolves over time
- Backward compatible with HTML4
- Includes error handling rules for better browser compatibility
- Focus on real-world usage rather than perfect markup

## Deprecated Features

Several HTML4 elements have been deprecated in HTML5:

- `<font>`, `<basefont>` (use CSS instead)
- `<center>` (use CSS text-align)
- `<strike>` (use CSS text-decoration)
- `<big>`, `<small>` (use CSS font-size)
- Frame-related elements like `<frameset>`, `<frame>` (though still supported, iframes preferred)

## Performance and Mobile

HTML5 includes features designed for modern web applications:

- Offline capability through Service Workers
- Responsive design support
- Better mobile device integration
- Support for touch events

## Conclusion

HTML5 represents a significant advancement over HTML4, focusing on modern web development needs including multimedia, semantics, offline capabilities, and better form handling. While HTML4 pages will continue to work, adopting HTML5 provides access to powerful new features and better user experiences across devices.
